# Reading SMT-LIB input: lexing and parsing

Reading turns bytes into tokens (the lexer) and tokens into the syntactic categories and
commands of SMT-LIB (the parser), which are delivered to a command handler in streaming
fashion: the input is processed piece by piece and every category or command to be handled
reaches the handler before the next one is read.

For simple usage, use `readSmt` and `readSmtFile`.

`Reader` reads the same way from any sequence of buffers and keeps the parser's resources
under the caller's control, so it is the entry point when the input does not arrive as one
buffered reader or when the resources should serve several reads. The lexer and the parser can
also be used on their own.

/--
Streams SMT-LIB input from bytes to a command handler.

A reader owns its lexer, its parser, the parser resources, and the handler. Any parser can be
used, and a convenience constructor `Reader.script` is provided for the common case of reading
SMT-LIB scripts.

The input is read either whole, through `readFile` or `readAll`, or in pieces, using
`readSlice` sequentially, followed by `readEof` once the input has ended. A piece may end
anywhere, even inside a token.

After a call of `readAll` or `readEof` that does not return an error, the reader is reset and
can be reused. A call that returns an error gives no reader back, only the handler, which the
failure carries.

For whole inputs, consider `readSmtFile` and `readSmt`.

/- LEAN: Rust's bound `H: SmtHandler` is the instance argument `Handler H m`. Rust's default
parser `SmtScriptParser<H>` is the default of `P`, made where `Reader H` is written without a
parser (`Internal.scriptParser`), as Rust checks its default against the bounds only where it is
used: the script parser needs `CommandHandler H m`, which the bound `Handler H m` does not
give. -/

lexer will always comply. No standard parser changes versions except for `ScriptParser`.

resets the version to the initial one.

contract; here it is an obligation on the caller, answered by `none`, as `Lexer.lexEof` does. -/
/--
Processes the end of the input.

Returns the located parser result if successful, and the reader, reset. A parser that continues
on the end of the input breaks its contract; the result is then `none`.

Call this once after the last `readSlice`; `readFile` and `readAll` call it themselves.

If an error occurs, the reader is not given back; the failure carries the handler.

Reads the slice as the whole input.

Returns the located parser result if successful, `none` if the parser broke its contract (see
`readEof`), and the reader, reset.

  | .error err => return .error err

/- LEAN: Rust's `read_from` takes `&mut self` and the buffered reader; this takes the reader and
the buffered reader and gives both back, the buffered reader also after an error. The loop is the
recursion, a tail call; it is `partial`, as a buffered reader may give bytes without end. -/
/--
Reads the content of the buffered reader.

Returns the located parser result if successful, `none` if the parser broke its contract (see
`readEof`), and the reader, reset; and, in any case, the buffered reader.

The input is considered to end when the buffered reader returns no bytes. A failure while
reading is reported as an I/O error with an empty span at the position reached.

The buffer content is consumed up to where the parser requests discarding the rest or fully if
no such request was made. Once the parser has requested discarding, the end of the input is
processed without reading further.

If an error occurs, the reader is not given back; the failure carries the handler.
